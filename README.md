This repo holds the code and docs for automating Azure resource deployment with Terraform, focusing on a CI/CD pipeline for data engineering. It integrates Azure Storage Accounts and Data Factory for efficient data workflows.

## Key Features
- Terraform-driven automation of Azure resources.  
- Modular, scalable infrastructure design.  
- Enhanced data pipeline orchestration with Azure Data Factory.  

## Technologies
- Terraform  
- Azure (Storage Accounts, Data Factory)  
- CI/CD practices  

Dive into the code to see infrastructure-as-code in action for data engineering!
